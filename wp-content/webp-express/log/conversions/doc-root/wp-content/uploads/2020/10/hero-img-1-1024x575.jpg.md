Converting to lossy
Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: *Exec failed* (the cwebp binary was not found at path: cwebp)
Nope a plain cwebp call does not work
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Linux)... We do. We in fact have 3
Found 3 binaries:

Encoding is set to auto - converting to both lossless and lossy and selecting the smallest file

Converting to lossy
Quality of source is 82. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
Reduction: 42% (went from 58 kb to 34 kb)

Converting to lossless
Reduction: -245% (went from 58 kb to 201 kb)

Picking lossy
vips succeeded :)

Converted image in 1462 ms, reducing file size with 42% (went from 58 kb to 34 kb)
